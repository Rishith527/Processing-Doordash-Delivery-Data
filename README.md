# AWS Lambda CI/CD with CloudWatch

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for an AWS Lambda function using AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, and GitHub. The Lambda function reads a CSV file from an S3 bucket, processes it using the pandas library, and logs the output to CloudWatch Logs.
